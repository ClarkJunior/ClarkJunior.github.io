        <p><img  src= https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3cfIxQXPX1M/maxresdefault.jpg width="500" height="250" align="left"> There are 6 different roles in the game. The 6 different roles are Assassin, Fighter, Mage, Support, Tank, and Marksman. They all play a specific part in the team and each one of them is equally needed. As you can see on the picture to the left this is Cho'Gath and his main role is Tank. Tanks are usually the ones that lead the fight and soak up most of the damge from the enemy teammates because they have more health, magic resistance and armor to take up more hits. </p>
